    "- Using libraries can be as easy as to download them to our files; but managing them is annoying\n",
    "- We should use libraries seperately, project by project to avoid conflicts.\n",
    "- In Python, there are _virtual environments_.\n",
    "- Python has a module called 'venv' that can build virtual environments.\n",

    "### Importing Libraries through the Terminal:\n",
    "- Open up the terminal window (Windows)\n",
    "- Use the commad 'cd' (change directory) to change to a directory\n",
    "- Use the command 'mkdir' (make directory) to make a directory\n",
    "- Use the command 'python -m venv' to create a virtual environment\n",
    "- Use 'cd' to enter the directory \"Scripts\"\n",
    "- Use the command 'activate' to activate the virtual environment\n",
    "- Use the command 'dir'(Windows) to show information about the directory\n",
    "- Use the command '..' to go back to the parent directory\n",
    "- Use 'mkdir' to create a new directory called src\n",
    "- Use 'cd' to enter src\n",
    "- Use the command 'pip install pygame' to install pygame in the virtual environment\n",
